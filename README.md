# M2E support for basepom.org

If plugins are executed early (in the validate phase), Eclipse m2e
will fail to build these projects because it does not know how to deal
with the plugins before the compile phase.

This project contains m2e extensions to ignore the following plugins in Eclipse:

- [1] Mycila license plugin (http://code.mycila.com/license-maven-plugin/)
- [1] Ning duplicate finder plugin (https://github.com/ning/maven-duplicate-finder-plugin)
- [1] Ning dependency versions check plugin (https://github.com/ning/maven-dependency-versions-check-plugin)
- [1] org.basepom duplicate finder plugin (https://github.com/basepom/duplicate-finder-maven-plugin)
- [2] org.basepom property-helper plugin (https://github.com/basepom/property-helper-maven-plugin)
- [3] Apache Axis2 wsdl2code plugin (https://axis.apache.org/axis2/java/core/tools/maven-plugins/maven-wsdl2code-plugin.html)

which can be used in the "verify" stage. All m2e extensions can be
discovered through the m2e catalog and installed in Eclipse to get rid
of the build errors.

* [1] m2e extension only disables the plugin in Eclipse.

* [2] m2e extension adds plugin goals to lifecycle, which can be used in
any stage but is most useful in `validate`. The `get` goal of this
plugin will be executed by Eclipse, the `inc` goal is ignored .


* [3] m2e extension detects folders with autogenerated code and adds it to the eclipse project.

The axis2-wsdl2code plugin heavily borrowed code from the axistools
